## Introduction

This is where it all begins! Odin Recipes is the first project from Foundation Course of The Odin Project. It's time to put into practice all my acquired **HTML** knowledge. I also learned a little about **CSS** to bring the project to an acceptable look. It took a little hard work to get it looking acceptable, but it was worth it. In this project, I have created a small section that shows three exciting recipes in my opinion.

<br>

## Main page

The main section consists of a main index page with links to a few selected recipes. Each recipe contains an ```image```, ```title``` and ```rating``` briefly describing the internal content. An effect has also been added when ```hovering``` over a recipe for more intuitive navigation.

## Inner page

The structure of the inner page is distributed as follows:

1. The main block ```main``` contains two sections – ```aside``` and ```article```.
2. ```aside``` *(left)* contains an ```image``` of the finished dish.
3. ```article``` *(right)* contains a number of important sections – ```header```, ```section``` and ```footer``` the contents of which can be viewed by scrolling down.

<br>

The ```header``` consists of ```breadcrumbs```, ```heading```, optional ```buttons``` and ```rating```. It is followed by a ```blockquote``` and details about the preparation of this dish.

What follows is a brief introduction and an ```unordered list``` of the Ingredients section.

The Directions section contains a step-by-step ```ordered list``` of actions for the exact cooking process.

The Nutrition Facts section contains a brief description of the main substances necessary for the life and health of a living organism.

The Recommended section contains cards with ```links``` to other recipes for quick access to them. Also added a ```footer``` for quick navigation to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/ok1edok1e/odin-recipes).
